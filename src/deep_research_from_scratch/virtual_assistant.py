ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:
1. **Query Clarity**: Is the query specific enough or too broad?
2. **Research Mode Fit**: Which research mode would work best?
3. **Keyword Optimization**: What key terms would improve results?
4. **Scope Refinement**: How can we narrow or broaden appropriately?
5. **Expected Outcomes**: What kind of results should the user expect?

RESEARCH MODES AVAILABLE:
- **Basic Research**: Fast web search for current info, news, trends
- **MCP Research**: Local document analysis and file-based research  
- **Enhanced MCP Research**: Local files + statistical data from Data Commons
- **Full Research**: Comprehensive multi-agent analysis with detailed reports

SCOPING STRATEGIES:
- **Too Broad**: Add specific constraints (time, location, industry, etc.)
- **Too Narrow**: Expand scope or suggest related areas
- **Unclear Intent**: Ask clarifying questions or suggest alternatives
- **Mode Mismatch**: Recommend better research mode for the query type

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Provide exactly 3 alternative scopings as JSON:
